**Effortless parallelism for your React and JS/TS apps.**

A blazing-fast, ergonomic Web Worker pool library powered by [Comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink). Developed with Bun for fast builds and tests, but works in any modern JS/TS/React app. Offload CPU-intensive work to a pool of workers, maximize throughput, and keep your UI smooth.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Install from your monorepo root:

```bash
bun add comlink-worker-pool
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install comlink-worker-pool
```

## Usage

Import and use the worker pool in your app:

```ts
import { WorkerPool } from "comlink-worker-pool";
import * as Comlink from "comlink"; // or your Comlink import

// Define your worker API interface
type WorkerApi = {
  fibAsync(n: number): Promise<number>;
};

// Create the worker pool
const pool = new WorkerPool<
  { method: string; args: unknown[] }, // Task type
  unknown, // Result type (can be more specific)
  WorkerApi // Proxy type
>({
  size: 2,
  workerFactory: () =>
    new Worker(new URL("./worker.ts", import.meta.url), { type: "module" }),
  proxyFactory: (worker) => Comlink.wrap<WorkerApi>(worker),
  onUpdateStats: (stats) => console.log("Pool stats:", stats),
  workerIdleTimeoutMs: 30000, // Optional: terminate idle workers after 30s
  maxTasksPerWorker: 100, // Optional: terminate workers after 100 tasks
  maxWorkerLifetimeMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Optional: terminate workers after 5 minutes
});

// Use the API proxy for ergonomic calls
const api = pool.getApi();
const result = await api.fibAsync(10);
console.log(result); // Output: 55

// Get live pool stats
console.log(pool.getStats());
```

### Advanced Usage

- The pool is generic: `WorkerPool<T, R, P>`
  - `T`: Task type (must be `{ method: string; args: unknown[] }` for proxy mode)
  - `R`: Result type
  - `P`: Proxy type (your worker API interface)

### Worker Lifecycle Management

The WorkerPool supports automatic worker termination based on different criteria to prevent memory leaks and ensure optimal performance:

#### Task-Based Termination (`maxTasksPerWorker`)
```ts
const pool = new WorkerPool<WorkerApi>({
  // ... other options
  maxTasksPerWorker: 100, // Terminate workers after 100 tasks
});
```
- Prevents memory leaks from long-running workers
- Ensures fresh worker state periodically
- Useful for workers that accumulate state over time

#### Time-Based Termination (`maxWorkerLifetimeMs`)
```ts
const pool = new WorkerPool<WorkerApi>({
  // ... other options
  maxWorkerLifetimeMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Terminate workers after 5 minutes
});
```
- Limits worker lifetime to prevent resource accumulation
- Useful for workers that may develop memory leaks over time
- Ensures periodic refresh of worker processes

#### Idle Termination (`workerIdleTimeoutMs`)
```ts
const pool = new WorkerPool<WorkerApi>({
  // ... other options
  workerIdleTimeoutMs: 30 * 1000, // Terminate idle workers after 30 seconds
});
```
- Reduces resource usage when demand is low
- Workers are recreated on-demand when needed
- Helps with memory management in variable-load scenarios

All lifecycle management options can be combined for comprehensive worker management.

### Concurrent Task Execution

By default, each worker processes tasks sequentially (one at a time). However, you can configure workers to handle multiple tasks concurrently, which is especially beneficial for I/O-bound operations or tasks that involve waiting.

#### Basic Concurrent Execution

```ts
const pool = new WorkerPool<WorkerApi>({
  size: 2,
  maxConcurrentTasksPerWorker: 3, // Allow up to 3 concurrent tasks per worker
  workerFactory: () => new Worker(new URL("./worker.ts", import.meta.url)),
  proxyFactory: (worker) => Comlink.wrap<WorkerApi>(worker),
});

// These 6 tasks will run on 2 workers, with up to 3 tasks per worker concurrently
const results = await Promise.all([
  api.fetchData("url1"),  // Worker 1, Task 1
  api.fetchData("url2"),  // Worker 1, Task 2  
  api.fetchData("url3"),  // Worker 1, Task 3
  api.fetchData("url4"),  // Worker 2, Task 1
  api.fetchData("url5"),  // Worker 2, Task 2
  api.fetchData("url6"),  // Worker 2, Task 3
]);
```

#### When to Use Concurrent Execution

**‚úÖ Good for:**
- I/O-bound operations (network requests, file operations)
- Tasks with async waiting periods
- Database queries
- API calls

**‚ùå Avoid for:**
- CPU-intensive computations (use more workers instead)
- Tasks that compete for the same resources
- Memory-intensive operations

#### Performance Considerations

```ts
// For I/O-bound tasks: Higher concurrency can improve throughput
const ioPool = new WorkerPool<ApiWorker>({
  size: 2,
  maxConcurrentTasksPerWorker: 10, // High concurrency for I/O
  // ...
});

// For CPU-bound tasks: Use more workers instead of concurrency
const cpuPool = new WorkerPool<ComputeWorker>({
  size: navigator.hardwareConcurrency || 4, // More workers
  maxConcurrentTasksPerWorker: 1, // Sequential processing (default)
  // ...
});
```

#### Updated Statistics

When using concurrent execution, the pool statistics include additional information:

```ts
const stats = pool.getStats();
console.log({
  runningTasks: stats.runningTasks, // Total tasks currently executing
  availableForConcurrency: stats.availableForConcurrency, // Workers that can accept more tasks
  // ... other existing stats
});
```

## Example Worker

```ts
// worker.ts
export function fibAsync(n: number): number {
  return n <= 1 ? n : fibAsync(n - 1) + fibAsync(n - 2);
}
```

## API Reference

- `getApi(): P` ‚Äî Returns a proxy for calling worker methods as if local (recommended).
- `getStats(): WorkerPoolStats` ‚Äî Returns live stats about the pool.
- `terminateAll(): void` ‚Äî Terminates all workers and clears the pool.

### WorkerPoolStats Interface

```ts
interface WorkerPoolStats {
  size: number;                    // Configured maximum number of workers
  available: number;               // Workers available to take new tasks
  queue: number;                   // Tasks waiting in the queue
  workers: number;                 // Currently instantiated workers
  idleWorkers: number;             // Workers with no running tasks
  runningTasks: number;            // Total tasks currently executing
  availableForConcurrency: number; // Workers that can accept additional concurrent tasks
}
```

**Key differences with concurrent execution:**
- `idleWorkers`: Workers with zero running tasks
- `runningTasks`: Total count of all executing tasks across all workers
- `availableForConcurrency`: Workers that haven't reached their `maxConcurrentTasksPerWorker` limit

## Development

- **Build the library:**
  ```bash
  bun run --filter comlink-worker-pool build
  ```
- **Run tests:**
  ```bash
  bun run --filter comlink-worker-pool test
  ```

## Playground Demo

Try the live playground demo here: [https://natanelia.github.io/comlink-worker-pool/](https://natanelia.github.io/comlink-worker-pool/)

If you want to run it locally, see the [playground README](../playground/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

- Worker file paths must be valid URLs relative to the importing module.
- If you encounter module resolution issues in the playground, try rebuilding the worker pool package.
